# FEWD-challenge1
Front-End Web Development Bootcamp course - challenge1

## Description

This project was developed to provide us with an on-the-job ticket task, which challenges us to find the flaws in the code and work to improve it for a certain goal. The problem it was solving was to make it more accessible, improve the SEO and consolidate the CSS by following the scout rule.

Things I learnt:
- There are lots of little nuances and ways of working with VS code which I need to learn
- How fragile it all is and how one small error can turn your whole beautiful webpage into an ugly mess!!
- I need to learn how to comment better
- I understand the need for a second screen and why it is important to git commit often!!

## User Story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria

Your website must meet accessibility standards. You can achieve this completing the following:

* Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
* HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
* Heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title
